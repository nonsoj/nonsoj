### Hi I'm Nonso JohnðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring systems, AI, and security in my personal time, with a focus on web and low-level security and ML.

ðŸŒ± I work primarily with Python and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn more.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting projects using Python and JavaScript, especially those related to backend and web infrastructures.
